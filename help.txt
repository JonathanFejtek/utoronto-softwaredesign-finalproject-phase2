**phase2:**

To compile program type the following into the terminal:
javac -Xlint main/Main.java

To run the program type the following into the terminal:
java main.Main

- Note:
- Please only run one instance of the program at a time to ensure that persistence files don't corrupt; we did not have
time in phase2 to ensure that only one instance of the program can run at a time.
- If the program ever gets buggy or ~strange~, try deleting serializedimages.ser and serializedtags.ser and nameLog.txt
- In rare instances, the view will get 'stuck', and tags will fail to add/delete/etc. Try clicking around or changing
images and it usually resolves itself.
- If an image that has been tagged is renamed outside of the program, the program does not behave as expected (*shrug*)
